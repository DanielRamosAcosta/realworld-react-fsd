There is always something missing, no matter how many times I go to the pet store.

So when it comes to Christmas, I love receiving something for my cats too; it makes me happy, saves some money, and I know they would appreciate it too.

If you are looking for a gift for a cat owner, pick one from the list below, and you will get it right!

# Blanket and cushions
Cats love boxes, but they love them even more if you put inside them a soft cushion. The cat’s bed gets even more comfortable with a soft and cozy blanket. These two items are essential for a perfect place where to nap during cold months.

There are also beds you can hang to the radiator for cats sensitive to cold temperatures.

My cats wander outside, so I wash their blankets often because they get filthy fast. Sometimes I feel like I don’t have enough blankets for my five cats, so I can’t help buying more during sales.`,

I dare you to name one thing cuter than a cat’s toe beans. They’re soft and tiny, and if your cat is comfortable enough, you can even hold them. And their bellies! If a cat shows you its belly, that means it trusts you. What’s better than knowing you’ve earned the trust of your pet?
